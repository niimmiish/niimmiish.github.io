Hi! I am Nimish. I help people <font color="#c0392b">make sense of data</font>. I am interested in the overlap of data and technology — eager to understand what data can reveal and to guide organizations navigate quantitative and qualitative information for effective use. 

I live in Northern Virginia, and as an <font color="#c0392b">independent consultant</font> am often working remotely with distributed colleagues. I love the outdoors and am into backpacking, distance running, joyrides on my Surly, road trips...and discovering new breweries.

If you want to get in touch, send me a message at `nimisheth at gmail dot com`.

<span style="color: #2980b9; background-color:#ecf0f1">**Data is everywhere. Data touches everything. Data is empowering.**</span>

Digging into data is called by different names — <span style="color: ">statistics, data mining, quantitative analysis, data science, machine learning, operations research</span>. But I believe no matter the label and the problem, to implement meaningful solutions it is critical to understand the intersection and interaction of business, data, technology, and human behavior. It's what I do.

<span style="color: #2980b9; background-color:#ecf0f1">**Get curious. Ask questions. Challenge convention. Make positive impact.**</span>

- I can help from defining the problem and data requirements to designing data flows and data quality processes to analysis, visualization, insights, modeling, and production use.
- I am fluent in SQL and fairly proficient with R. I want to get better at Python (working on it).
- I learn fast and can speak the language of business and technology and translate between the two.

# What Have I Done
Over the past 22 years I have worked in all aspects of <font color="#c0392b">data solutions</font> --- as a data miner, data scientist, data integration engineer, analytics engineer, product analyst, implementation consultant, and more.

I was an early, core data miner at Mantas, a start up that pioneered financial crime detection software (subsequently acquired by Oracle). At SRA International, I designed and implemented data integration for the U.S. Dept. of Defense military logistics and in-transit cargo visibility for post 9/11 theater ops. From 2014 - 2021, I provided independent analytics consulting services to leading financial institutions for validating and remediating automated compliance systems used for financial crime monitoring and prevention. At Orum, a fintech startup, I led the development of strategy, framework, and data architecture for mitigating payments risk and financial crime. For more details, take a look at my [resume][1]{: style="color: #343434"} and [portfolio][2]{: style="color: #343434"}.

I step outside every now and then. I've rambled through 44 national parks with my wife, mostly tenting and backpacking. I like doing destination marathons and half-marathons, bagging states (visited the 48 contiguous U.S. states), and hitting interesting geographic extreme points: [Mt. Whitney][] (highest point in the lower 48), [Badwater Basin][] (lowest point in the U.S.), [Belle Fourche][] (geographic center of the 50 U.S. states), [Lake Itasca][] (headwaters of the Mississippi), [West Quoddy Head][] (easternmost point of the lower 48), and many more).

# The Early Years
In college, I wanted to be a professional photographer[^fnote1], capturing people and their lives in their day-to-day environment. But as it happened, I became an accidental Math major. After a stint as a freelance photographer and TV series editor[^fnote2], I earned a Master's in <font color="#c0392b">Industrial Engineering</font> from <font color="#c0392b">Virginia Tech</font>, where I did my [dissertation][3]{: style="color: #343434"} on measuring efficiency of production units using [Data Envelopment Analysis][4].

Oh, and somewhere during this time, I worked as a music transfer specialist and did a crazy amount of urban cycling dodging vehicular traffic.

Enjoy browsing and thanks for visiting!

[^fnote1]: I traveled through India by rail, photographing life as I saw it. I still love photography and showcase some of it on my [Instagram account][5]{: style="color: #686de0"}.
[^fnote2]: I photographed legends of Indian classical music, freelanced with a journalist, edited a weekly TV show, and almost went to film school.
