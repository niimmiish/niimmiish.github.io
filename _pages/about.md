Hi! I am Nimish. I help people <font color="#c0392b">make sense of data</font>. I am interested in the overlap of data and technology — eager to understand what data can reveal and guide organizations navigate quantitative and qualitative information for effective use. 

I live in Northern Virginia, and as an <font color="#c0392b">independent consultant</font> am often working remotely with distributed colleagues. I love the outdoors and am into backpacking, distance running, joyrides on my Surly, road trips...and discovering new breweries.

If you want to get in touch, send me a message at `nimisheth at gmail dot com`.

Digging into data is called by different names — <span style="color: ">statistics, data mining, quantitative analysis, data science, machine learning, operations research</span>. But I believe no matter the label and the problem, a critical understanding of business, data, technology, human behavior, and their interaction is essential for implementing meaningful solutions. It's what I do.

<span style="color: #2980b9; background-color:#ecf0f1">**Get curious. Ask questions. Challenge convention. Make positive impact.**</span>

- I can help from defining the problem and data requirements to designing data flows and data quality processes to analysis, visualization, insights, modeling, and production use.
- I am fluent in SQL and fairly proficient with R. I want to get better at Python (working on it).

Over the past 18 years I have worked in all aspects of <font color="#c0392b">data solutions</font> --- as a data miner, data scientist, data integration engineer, product analyst, implementation consultant, and more. I was an early, core data miner at a start up that pioneered financial crime detection software (subsequently acquired by Oracle). I have led data integration design and implementation for military logistics and in-transit visibility for post 9/11 theater ops. For the past 7 years I have been freelancing as a data science consultant. My recent work has involved working with financial services firms to develop and validate compliance and regulatory models used for financial crime monitoring and prevention. For more details, take a look at my [resume][1]{: style="color: #2980b9"} and [portfolio][2]{: style="color: #2980b9"}.

In college, I wanted to be a professional photographer[^fnote1], capturing people and their lives in their day-to-day environment. But as it happened, I became an accidental Math major. After a stint as a freelance photographer and TV series editor[^fnote2], I got a Master's in <font color="#c0392b">Industrial Engineering</font> from <font color="#c0392b">Virginia Tech</font>, where I did my [dissertation][3]{: style="color: #2980b9"} on measuring efficiency of production units using [Data Envelopment Analysis][4]{: style="color: #686de0"}.

Enjoy browsing and thanks for visiting!

[^fnote2]: I photographed legends of Indian classical music, freelanced with a journalist, edited a weekly TV show, and almost went to film school.
